Hey! I'm Phil.  I started out as a farmer, went to school for mechanical engineering at the University of Virginia, and went to school again for mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois.  This time, I'm focused on building tools to help engineers design dynamic systems.

Though I'm trained in equations, calculators, and the art of taking tests, I approach my work more like an artist or designer would.  Prescriptive solutions are my Kryptonite; I am fueled by curiosity, creativity, and a dash of perfectionism.  

I am steadily inspired by the first and foremost Creator, whose work sets an impossibly high standard to which I aspire.  He also provided a useful guidebook whose principles I aim to apply to my own work (fix this sentence).  A few key points are:

1. My relationship with **God** comes **first**

    He takes care of the rest.

    >"Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established" (Proverbs 16.3).

2. I **love** doing what I do

    >"[T]here is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for that is his lot" (Ecclesiastes 4.5).
3. To work is to **serve**

    >"Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men... You are serving the Lord Christ" (Colossians 3.23-24).

4. I am to use the **tools** and **resources** I've been given to do **excellent** work

    **Tools**
    >"I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with ability and intelligence, with knowledge and all craftsmanship, to devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze, in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, to work in every craft" (Exodus 31.2-5).

    For those of us not whom God did not directly ordain, He continues:

    >"I have given to all able men ability, that they may make all that I have commanded you" (Exodus 31.6).

    **Resources**
    >"'Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.' His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant'" (Matthew 24.20-21).

5. I'm never done learning

    >"Never be wise in your own sight" (Romans 12:16).

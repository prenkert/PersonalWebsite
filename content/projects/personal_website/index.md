# Outline
- Need for a website
    - Document what I've worked on; things I've learned
    - Do so in a public space, allowing others to learn, and have something to point to during interviews. A sort of interactive online resume. Why use words to convince people of who you are and what you're capable of when you can show them what you've dont and let them judge for themselves?
- Setting a Direction
    - Logical thing to do would be to hop onto Squarespace and "create a website in minutes." But what fun would that be?
    - As someone who spends much of their day coding, building a website the hard way felt like a right of passage. 
    - Coding a website also offers much more flexibility. Because my projects span everything from photography to software development to mechanical design to arts and crafts, I needed a very flexible framework that sits somewhere between portfolio and blog. I wanted something that was media-focused (pictures are worth a thousand words, and I'm a slow writer), but would allow me to dive into the details when necessary. 
    - My primary inspiration was Garret Vercoe, an acquaintance from the University of Virginia whos [personal website](https://garrettvercoe.com/), with it's project-focused horizontal scroll design, neatly fit my requirements. His design provided a great starting point for me to get up and running. 
- Building the website
    - The site is built with with Gatsby.js, a React-based static site generator. I appreciate the simplicity and speed of the static site generator, and limitless flexibility for sourcing content. 
    - I'm currently using Netlify to deploy the site. I love it's git-oriented workflow.
